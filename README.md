# esp-s0

This project contains the code needed to log pulses from an S0 bus, such as the ones
usually provided by installation power meters, to a remote database using the ESP8266
microcontroller with integrated wireless stack.



## Building

In order to build the code for the ESP, you will need a suitable build environment, such as
[esp-open-sdk](https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk). Edit the paths at the top of
[esp/makefile](esp/makefile) to match your setup.
